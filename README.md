  An app that displays a list of records extracted from the burgers table, 
  rendered in html by handlebars js, along with an "EAT" button.  Clicking 
  on the "EAT" button updates the database "devoured" boolean, and moves the
  burger displayed to the right side of the screen, with a different background
  color.

  There is also an option to add new burgers, which inserts a new record into
  the burgers table.
